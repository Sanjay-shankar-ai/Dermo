# Dermotology Disease Prediction Using Deep learning 

## Problem Statement
```
To Develop an AI-based model that can predict dermatology 
Diseases and Explanation System.

Innovative Solution
The project began with the acquisition of a diverse and labeled 
dataset of dermatological images. This dataset recognized for its 
quality and relevance, formed the cornerstone of our project. Data 
Augmentation techniques were applied to enhance dataset diversity. 
The modal was created using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), 
why CNN? â€“ CNN plays a Vital role in image-related processes due to 
its ability to automatically extract features, understand spatial 
hierarchies, and be robust to image variations, also offers translation 
invariance and scalability, making it effective for recognizing complex 
patterns.Trained the model using the dermatology dataset, finetuning
it to improve its prediction accuracy. Modal performance and 
reliability are validated by cross-validation and validation sets. A key 
attribute of our model is its ability to provide easily understandable 
explanations alongside its predictions, making it more accessible and 
user-friendly
